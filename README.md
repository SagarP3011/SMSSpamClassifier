# SMS Spam Classifier

This repository contains the completed tasks for my internship in Machine Learning at Encryptix. The tasks involved implementing various machine learning models and solving real-world problems. Below are the details of the tasks completed:

## Task 4: SMS Spam Classifier

**Objective:** Classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam) based on their content.

**Details:**
- Collected a labeled dataset of SMS messages.
- Preprocessed the text data by cleaning and tokenizing.
- Explored various features like word frequency and TF-IDF scores.
- Implemented several machine learning models including Naive Bayes, SVM, and logistic regression.
- Evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Selected the best model and fine-tuned it for better performance.

**Files:**
-  Contains the dataset used for the analysis.
- `Jupyter notebook with data exploration, model building, and evaluation.
-  Saved models and other relevant files.
